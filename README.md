# Ruby on Rails Project: IreHouse

   The application is developed for both mobile phone and website using Ruby on Rails and 
Bootstrap frameworks to implement that the international students can easily rent satisfying 
houses and seek lovely roommates in Ireland and the local people who are willing to share or 
rent their houses, can put up some information and communicate with the students who want to 
rent houses.
