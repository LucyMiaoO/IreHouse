# Ruby on Rails Project: IreHouse

   The application is developed for both mobile phone and website using Ruby on Rails and 
Bootstrap frameworks to implement that the international students can easily rent satisfying 
houses and seek lovely roommates in Ireland and the local people who are willing to share or 
rent their houses, can put up some information and communicate with the students who want to 
rent houses.

This is the welcome page of my website. If you are a new user, you can sign up of log in with your Facebook account. If you have signed up already, you can click on the yellow circle button to log in.

By the way, the blue circle button is to control the sidebar menu. If you click on it, the sidebar menu will be invisible.

When you log in, you can see the lists of houses in Ireland. The sidebar menu shows the amount of houses in each city and links to help and about page. The circle buttons in the top are people commonly used. The white one links to the homepages of users while the blue one links to the settings. If you want to log out, you can click on the yellow button.

Look at the homepage. There are two parts for both tenants and landlords. Tenants can check their help information; wish lists and reservations while landlords can view their house information and receipts.

If you are a tenant and want to find a house in Waterford, you can click the sidebar menu linking to Waterford and chose one you like. In the Detail page you can see the block of Google map under the address. The red circle heart button helps the user to add this house to the wish list. The blue circle credit card button links to the reservation page.

If you click on the map, you can see the streetscape near by. If you want to rent this house, you can add it to your wish list first. Just click on the red circle heart button and rating the house, the house is added to your wish list successfully.

As you can see, the house is in the wish list now. If you want to see the detail information or are ready to pay the deposit, you can click on the address to back to the house detail page. If you want to know more about this house, you can click on the landlord email address.

Click on the email address of the landlord, a draft email with specific object will be shown automatically. You can send this email to the landlord to ask for more detail information. All the email links in my website have the same functionality, which can be clicked on and then send email automatically.

When you fill in the reservation form, you just need a credit card to pay for the deposit. Meanwhile, you can also leave a message to the landlord if you want. After that, you will receive a reservation history, which you can check it in your homepage.

At the same time, the landlord can receive the receipt with the detail personal information of the tenant on it. As I mentioned before, the landlord can also click on the email address of the tenant to contact him or her. In addition, the landlord can click on the address and view the house information as well.

This is “My House” page that can help the landlords to manage their houses. They can view, edit and delete the house information via the colourful circle button on the right. Besides, they can click on “Add new house” button to create a piece of new house information.

At last, this is about page with two blocks on it. One is about the developer and another is the email address to contact the administrator. The blue button below is for the user to like and share my website on Facebook.

The Android app has the same user interface with the website, so the manual is the same too. However, the sidebar menu is invisible when you log in. Just click on the blue circle menu button to see the sidebar menu.

My application has the administrator who has top permission to manage all the information in the database. As you can see, the dashboard lists all the tables in my database. If someone has bad effect on the application, this user will be forbidden by the administrator via this part of website. In the same way, the administrator can view, edit and delete all the information in the database of my website. In addition, the administrator can search and collect the useful information to do some analysis.
